TODO list for Perl module HTTP::CheckProxy

- Convert to use LWP::Paralell::UserAgent
- modify new() to use named parameters
  so that both are optional and independent
- Add testing for open (anonymous access) SOCKS proxy.
  This is not compatible with LWP, it does not know about SOCKS.
  The optimal solution is to modify or subclass LWP so it has this extra transport.
