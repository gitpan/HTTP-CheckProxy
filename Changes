Revision history for Perl module HTTP::CheckProxy

0.1 Mon Mar  1 11:43:14 2004
	- original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.32

0.4	Now supporting tests on more than just port 80. specifically
	does not test 1080, thats SOCKS. But it checks a lot of others.
	Commonly, hits are achieved on port 80 and 8080.
	new() now does not -require- its parameter. If you want to test
	more than one proxy don't bother making a new object just use
	the test() method. new() also now takes a 2nd optional parameter
	which is the url to try to get the proxy to fetch.
