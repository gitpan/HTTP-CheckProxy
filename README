NAME
    HTTP::CheckProxy - Perl module for testing for open proxies

SYNOPSIS
      use HTTP::CheckProxy

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses LWP to test the supplied IP address to see if it will
    promiscuosly proxy on port 80. Caution: this can have false alarms if
    you are on a network where you are supposed to go through a proxy, such
    as AOL -- but are you supposed to be running a webserver on such a
    network ?

    If you feed this an invalid ip address, LWP will complain.

    Note: while there is HTTP::ProxyCheck it is much slower, though it does
    a lot of input validation. HTTP::CheckProxy is intended to be useful in
    processing lots of candidate proxies and in recording useful
    information. To do this, make one object and repeatedly invoke the
    test() method with different IP addresses.

USAGE
      my $open_proxy_test = HTTP::CheckProxy->new($ip);
      print "proxy test for $ip returns ".$open_proxy_test->code."\n";
      print ($open_proxy_test->guilty? "guilty" : "innocent");
      $open_proxy_test->test($ip2);
      print "proxy test for $ip2 returns ".$open_proxy_test->code."\n";
      print ($open_proxy_test->guilty? "guilty" : "innocent");

METHODS
  new
     Usage     : HTTP::CheckProxy->new($ip);
     Purpose   : constructor
     Returns   : object instance
     Argument  : Optional first paramenter:
                    name or ip address of candidate proxy. Do not include http:// .
                 Optional second parameter: url (including the http://) to try to fetch. If this is invalid or unreachable the results of the test are meaningless, but this is NOT checked.
     Throws    : We should probably throw an exception if the ip address under test is unreachable
     Comments  : 

    See Also : HTTPD::ADS::AbuseNotify for sending complaints about
    validated proxies and other abuse.

  get_proxy_port
     Usage     :  $open_proxy_test->get_proxy_port;
     Purpose   : tell which port successfully proxied 
     Returns   : 16-bit integer port number
     Argument  : none
     Throws    : nothing
     Comments  : only valid when  $open_proxy_test->guilty is TRUE , may be undef otherwise (or have incorrect info if you reused the object)! 
    See Also   : HTTPD::ADS::AbuseNotify for sending complaints about validated proxies and other abuse.

  guilty
     Usage     : $open_proxy_test->guilty
     Purpose   : Is in fact the tested host guilty of being an open proxy?
     Returns   : true (its an open proxy) or false (it isn't)
     Argument  : none
     Throws    : nothing
     Comments  : This method checks the return status code of the test. If an error code is returned, esp. code 500, the host is not guilty. If the status code is success, the host is guilty.

  code
     Usage     : $open_proxy_test->code
     Purpose   : Return the status code of the proxy test
     Returns   : HTTP status code
     Argument  : none
     Throws    : nothing
